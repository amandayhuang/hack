### Background & Motivation

Older adults and homebound people are at risk for social isolation. Phone a Friend aims to create positive social experiences by connecting them with volunteers through weekly 30 minute phone calls. Through working with nonprofits like [Front Porch](https://covia.org/programs/social-call/volunteers/) and city agencies like [NYC Department for the Aging](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dfta/index.page) we would onboard these individuals to Phone a Friend. From there, anyone can sign up to be matched with them and start the conversation.
